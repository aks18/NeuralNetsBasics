# NeuralNetsBasics
My codes & projects while learning basics of neural networks. 

The repository contains the following projects
1. Week 1
  * Building a basic sequential 2 layered neural network using **Keras** and **Tensorflow**

2. Week 2
  * Implementing neural networks to train the **Fashion MNIST** datasets. Learnt about classification & activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, Softmax, etc., finding number of weights in the neural network, architecture & finding the summary of a neural network architecture & evaluation metrics of the output, like accuracy, precision, recall, etc..
  * **Callbacks** to stop training once reached the desired level of evaluation metric.
  * Implemented both on MNIST data, to achieve over 99% accuracy

3. Week 3
  * Convolutional Neural Networks: **Convolutions** & different kinds of filters to highlight various features in an image. Using the convolutional neural network to reduce the size of input images while not losing the details of the data & images. Applying different filters to highlight different aspects of the image.
  * Pooling: Used convolutions & pooling to reduce the size of the input images, thereby speeding up the training process while not losing information hidden in the images and data.

4. Week 4
  * Using generators to pickup training & testing data itself.
  * Personal Project: building a CNN to predict whether the given image is a horse or a human using the above techniques.
